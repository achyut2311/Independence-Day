                <p class="info">
                    The Residency, also called as the British Residency and Residency Complex, is a group of several
                    buildings in a common precinct in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It served as the
                    residence for the British Resident General who was a representative in the court of the Nawab.

                <p class="info">
                    Be it the non-cooperation movement, salt make movement or the British leave India. When it came to
                    nationality, there was a markaz of the voters in this Amin-ud-Daula Park. The national flag of India
                    was first hoisted here during the freedom movement. There was also a movement to break the salt law
                    here. Even after independence, this park has been the center of movements for a long time.

            <li><h3>
                Raj Bhavan</h3>
                <img src="rajbhavan.jpg" alt="Raj Bhavan" height="30%" width="30%">
                <p class="info">
                    Raj Bhavan used to be Kothi Hayat Baksh (Hindi: कोठी हयात बकश, Urdu: کوٹھی حیات بکش). Major General
                    Claude Martin drew the layout of this building.

                    In the year 1798, after Nawab Asaf-ud-daula died, the East India Company made Sadaat Ali Khan the
                    new ruler. The new ruler liked buildings built up in European style by Major General Claude Martin.
                    As per his wishes the contract for construction of the Kothi was undertaken by Major General Claude
                    Martin.

                    Major General Claude Martin made the Kothi his residence and he used this building for his safety
                    guards and also for the safety of his armory.

                    Before India's independence Kothi Hayat Baksh was declared as a Government House, the official
                    residence of the Governor of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.

                    After independence its name was changed to Raj Bhavan
